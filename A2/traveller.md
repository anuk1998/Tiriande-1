We will be implementing the Traveller package in Java, version 1.8. The following is how we would implement the required functionality of the package: 

In order to create a network of towns, we would start by creating a `TownNetwork` class that will include an `int[ ][ ] adjMatrix` field which represents the adjacency matrix that defines which towns are connected to each other. This matrix will be constructed using the `ArrayList<Edge> edges` field, where `Edge` is a class in which each object contains a start and destination node, representing a connection between two towns. The nodes will be represented by `Town` objects. The `Town` class contains the following fields: `String name` representing the Town’s name, `Boolean isEmpty` representing whether the town is occupied or not, and `Character character_assignned` representing the `Character` that occupies the town, set to null upon initialization. The `Character` class contains one field, `String name` which represents the name of the character. In order to create a `TownNetwork` object, the other elements that exist within it will also be created (towns in the network and which towns are connected to each other). 

In order to place a `Character` in a particular `Town`, we will call a function `placeCharacter(Character c)` located in the `Town` class on a defined `Town` object. This function will assign the given `Character c ` to the `character_assigned` field of the `Town`. Also, it will set the `isEmpty` field in the `Town` object to `false`.

To determine whether a specified character can reach a designated town without running into any other characters, we will call a function `query()` in the `TownNetwork` class. We will traverse through the towns using the `adjMatrix` field with Dijkstra’s algorithm. We will include a modification to account for whether or not a particular town is empty. Specifically, during traversal, we will access the `isEmpty` field of each `Town` object in the path, and if it ever returns `false`, the `query()` function will return false. Otherwise, it will return true.

The overall structure of the package will be the following:

`class TownNetwork {
      int[][] adjMatrix;
      ArrayList<Edge> edges;
      
      boolean query();
 }
 
 class Edge {
      Town source;
      Town destination;
 }
 
 class Town {
      String name;
      boolean isEmpty;
      Character character_assigned;
      
      void placeCharacter(Character c);
 }
 
 class Character {
      String name;
 }`
