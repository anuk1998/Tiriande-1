In order to run and interact with our local Snarl game, these are the rules to follow and keep in mind:

1. Start the game by registering players. The game will assign you a random avatar from the following options: '¤', '@', '~', '$'
2. There are two types of adversaries that will be chasing you throughout the game: ghosts and zombies. Ghosts are denoted by
   a 'G', and zombies are denoted by a 'Z'.
3. After registering players, the game will start on the level you have chosen in your input.
4. In each level, the goal is to locate the key denoted by a '*', which will open the exit tile.
5. The closed exit tile will appear as '●' at the start of the level. 
   Once the key has been landed on by a player, the exit tile will open and appear as 'O'. 
6. Once the exit tile is open, the goal of the players is to travel through the level and land on the open exit.
7. Players need to enter their desired row and column position when prompted by the game. 
8. The player can move up to two cardinal points in any direction. They can move diagonally, but that counts as 2 cardinal moves. 
9. Zombies can move up to one cardinal point in any direction except for diagonally, and cannot land on door tiles, denoted by a '|'. 
   Therefore, zombies cannot leave the room they are spawned in. 
   Zombies will make a move towards the player closest to them by distance in the same room as them. 
10. Ghosts can move up to one cardinal point in any direction except for diagonally. 
   When a ghost lands on a wall tile, it transports to a random room in the level. 
   Ghosts will make a move towards the player closest to them by distance at any given point in the game, 
   regardless of which room the player is in.
11. If a player lands on an adversary, it self-eliminates and is expelled from the board. 
12. If an adversary lands on a player, the player is expelled from the board. 
13. If at least one player makes it through the open exit in the level, once the game ends
    (all other players have also exited or been expelled), the players win that level and move
    on to the next level in the list of total levels. 
14. If the players win the last level in the list of levels, the game is won.
15. If all players are expelled in a level, the game is lost.
16. The game continues through the levels consecutively. For example, if there are 5 total levels,
    and the players choose to start on level 3, once the players win level 5, the game is won. 
17. Have fun!!
