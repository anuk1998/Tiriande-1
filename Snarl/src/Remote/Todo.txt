To-do List for Milestone 9:

- Finish creating threading for multiple clients
- Abstract main method!! She too long
- parse JSON messages from clients
    - make different methods for different types of JSON messages
- Construct outgoing player messages (look at Milestone 7 for those methods -- maybe import that file?)
- In the 'try' in Server main, send a server welcome message to client as soon as
  they connect, and then in ClientThread, parse that message then have the client write back a response and
  then back in the Server class 'try' parse that response and send it to a list of registered names to be
  registered ASAP
- Write what happens after the while loop that accepts connections --> start the level

- Test that timeout happens after 60 seconds of inactivity and that it doesn't shut down the existing
  connections
- Test multiple clients being able to connect
