The strategies for determining the next move of adversaries are up to you, 
but they should be sufficiently different: a ghost should clearly take advantage 
of the additional movement possibilities. Additionally, it has to be clear that 
the adversaries react to a player in the vicinity by moving towards it.

Describe the strategies in Planning/adversary-strategies.md and include some 
example situations and the choices the adversary will make.
