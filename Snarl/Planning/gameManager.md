## Game Manager Interface


For now, the main task of the Game Manager is to accept players to 
the game and start a game with a single level, which will be 
provided. 

The purpose of this task is looking at how the Game Manager and Players should interact to start and run a single level. 
We are looking for data definitions, signatures and purpose statements Ã  la Fundies, or definitions and 
interface specifications approximating your chosen language (if it has such constructs). 
Feel free to use examples and diagrams.
