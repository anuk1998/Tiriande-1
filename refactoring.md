# Milestone 6 - Refactoring Report

**Team members:**
Giselle Briand and Anu Kandasamy

**Github team/repo:** Tiriande


## Plan

List areas of your code/design you'd like to improve with brief descriptions,
anything that comes to mind. Tip: translate this list into Github Issues.

* Clean up code/filter through unnecessary methods in `Level` class
* Move things from `Level` class into `GameManager`
* Look into different ASCII symbols for players/users -- they currently are all represented as 'P's
    * @, smiley face icon, $, etc.
    * Alternatively, look at 1, 2, 3, 4
* Look into different ASCII symbols for adversaries on the level board (they're all represented by 'A's)  
    * Z for Zombie
    * G for Ghost
* Include a list of waypoints field in the constructor of a `Hallway` object
* Create an inventory attribute for players
* Look into randomly generating hallways
* Change traversable room tile representation (possible a '.') in level board
